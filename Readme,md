# Game Engine Project

This is a project wrote by myself to help myself learn C++,

## Installation

1. import the .vxcproj file and hope that does it. Only works on windows
2. Idk. Make a better build system for me and submit a pull request if you figure it out for me.

## Disclaimer
This is an educational project Im making for myself in order to better my skills in terms of code organization, practicing OOP paradigms, etc. This should not be used as a guide for schooling, research relating to programming, etc.
